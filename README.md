SmsImporterS60
===========

SmsImporterS60 is a tool designed to import SMS from a Symbian S60 system, 
using the [SMS Exporter](http://terohasu.net/smsexporter.html) tool by Tero Hasu, 
to an Android system. The tool is running on an Android platform, starting 2.3+ and is just using the file 
produced by [SMS Exporter](http://terohasu.net/smsexporter.html).

This is the first release :)

For the little story I have switch from Symbian to Android, just backuping sms message using 
[SMS Exporter](http://terohasu.net/smsexporter.html). Then I realize that no standard Android app is capable of
importing the data produced by [SMS Exporter](http://terohasu.net/smsexporter.html). So here it is !
